This project involved developing a machine learning model to enable gesture-based control of a smart TV. 
The goal was to create a user-friendly experience that allows viewers to interact with the TV using five predefined hand gestures captured by a webcam.

This project showcases my proficiency in machine learning for computer vision tasks, particularly gesture recognition. I am adept at data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation, and I am passionate about developing innovative solutions that enhance user experience.

Suggestion: Better to download Anaconda as it will take care of most of the other packages and easier to setup a virtual workspace to work with multiple versions of key packages like python, opencv etc.

Developed a machine learning model to automate the classification of customer complaints for a financial company. The goal was to efficiently categorize incoming support tickets based on the mentioned products and services, enabling faster resolution and improved customer satisfaction.

Successfully implemented topic modeling to categorize unstructured customer complaints into relevant product/service categories.

Built and evaluated multiple supervised learning models, selecting the optimal one for accurate and efficient classification of new complaints.

Automated the customer support ticket system, leading to faster issue resolution and improved customer experience.

This project demonstrates my skills in natural language processing, topic modeling, and supervised machine learning. I am proficient in handling unstructured data, extracting meaningful features, and building effective classification models for real-world applications.

### Melanoma Detection

Developed a multiclass image classification model using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow to detect melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer.  The goal was to create a tool to assist dermatologists in early diagnosis.

Designed and implemented a CNN architecture tailored for melanoma classification, incorporating convolutional layers, max-pooling, and fully connected layers.

This project showcases my skills in deep learning, CNN architecture design, and image classification using TensorFlow. I am proficient in data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation for computer vision tasks.

### Financial-Models-Numerical-Methods

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/sajankedia/Financial-Models-Numerical-Methods)

This is just a collection of topics and algorithms that in my opinion are interesting.

It contains several topics that are not so popular nowadays, but that can be very powerful. Usually, topics such as PDE methods, LÃ©vy processes, Fourier methods or Kalman filter are not very popular among practitioners, who prefers to work with more standard tools.
The aim of these notebooks is to present these interesting topics, by showing their practical application through an interactive python implementation.

The following article sections will briefly touch on LSTM neuron cells, give a toy example of predicting a sine wave then walk through the application to a stochastic time series. The article assumes a basic working knowledge of simple deep neural networks.

### Human Activity Recognition

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using smartphones dataset and an LSTM RNN. Classifying the type of movement amongst six categories:

WALKING,
WALKING_UPSTAIRS,
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,
SITTING,
STANDING,
LAYING.
Compared to a classical approach, using a Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory cells (LSTMs) require no or almost no feature engineering. Data can be fed directly into the neural network who acts like a black box, modeling the problem correctly. Other research on the activity recognition dataset can use a big amount of feature engineering, which is rather a signal processing approach combined with classical data science techniques. The approach here is rather very simple in terms of how much was the data preprocessed.

Let's use Google's neat Deep Learning library, TensorFlow, demonstrating the usage of an LSTM, a type of Artificial Neural Network that can process sequential data / time series.
